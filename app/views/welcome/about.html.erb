<h2>What is <%= site_name(short: true) %>?</h2>
<p>The <%= site_name %> is a book, music, and video sharing community<% if r=site_region(long: true) %> operating in <%= r %><% end %>.</p>

<p>efl operates on library-like principles where each person can lend items upon request to other participants. We promote a bottom-up and de-centralized approach to sharing culture that can help you find cool people and share interesting material with them.</p>

<h2>How does it work?</h2>
<p><%= link_to 'Create an account', '/account/signup'%>, then list the books and videos that you own.
You will quickly be able to borrow from the multitude of books and other material in other
collections. You can search for specific authors or titles, browse individual
collections, find nearby users, or find people who like books in common with yours.
Read the reviews and then write your own when you finish the book!</p>

<p>When the owner of a book or video you're interested in has time for you to pick it up or meet you,
then you can borrow books and video (with a due date set by the owner).</p>

<p>Returning books late will get you negative feedback, while returning books promptly
will get you positive feedback. <strong>You are never under any obligation to lend an item if you don't feel comfortable doing so.</strong></p>

<h2>How do you manage trust?</h2>
<p>While this is a community site based on good will, we will have an ebay-style feedback system for managing trust. Lenders have the opportunity to leave positive or negative feedback for borrowers when an item is returned. These positive or negative points contribute to an overall "score" which lenders can use to gauge the trustworthiness or responsibility of a borrower. Lenders can also leave comments along with the points to be more specific.</p>

<h2>How it got started<a name="#START"></a></h2>
<p>So in late 2006 I realized I had lent my copy of Neuromancer to someone. Not only had this individual not returned it, but I had forgotten who it was.</p>
<p>Now, I love lending books. A lot. Ask my friends. But Neuromancer? Well losing that would be almost as bad as losing God Emperor of Dune... or The Dispossessed. So I resolved to never let it happen again, but I had no intention of turning into one of those lame book hermits who hoards their collection against. So I started hunting around for a desktop application that would let me catalogue my collection and keep notes about who had what. Pretty basic, right?</p>
<p>Thats when I discovered the <a href="http://communitylibrary.org">Distributed Library Project</a>. It sounded like what I wanted to do, plus I could share it with my friends! The broken code wasn't an issue to fix and pretty soon I had a customised version up and I started working. Eventually I partnered up with bct and we both got tired of PHP and the crufty code, so we redid the thing in Ruby on Rails, and here we are!</p>

<h2>How can I contribute?<a name="CONTRIBUTE"></a></h2>
<p>If you want to donate, right now we are vitally in need of good hardware to host on. Mostly though we have a pile of things we'd like to see done in terms of development.</p>
<p>We do our development on <a href="http://github.com">GitHub</a> off of <a href="http://github.com/medwards/free-library-on-rails/">this tree</a>. If you want to experiment, just clone the tree and request a pull once you have something for us. (note: As of 2008-12-23 the code is not yet under an open source license [figuring this out is slated for the near future]. For now any contributions will need to be licensed to myself so that I can re-license it properly in the future.)</p>
